# OccuTree

OccuTree is software which creates an interactive tree view for all taxa included in occurrence records downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Facility as a Darwin core archive (DwCA). The tree view is contained in a single, self-contained web page (HTML file) which can be displayed on any device eqiuped with a web browser.  

OccuTree is intended as a tool for building handy reference lists for specified taxonomic and geographic ranges. Here are a couple of examples:
* All taxa with GBIF occurrence records from Guam
* [Insects with GBIF occurrence records from Guam](https://aubreymoore.github.io/gbif-occurences-Guam-Insecta.html)

Source code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook (Python) which can be run for free on Google Colab. A tutorial is provided.
