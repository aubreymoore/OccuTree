# OccuTree

OccuTree is software which creates an interactive tree view for all taxa included in occurrence records downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Facility as a Darwin core archive (DwCA). The tree view is contained in a single, stand-alone web page (HTML file) which can be displayed on any device equiped with a web browser.  

OccuTree is intended as a tool for building handy reference lists for specified taxonomic and geographic ranges. Here are a couple of examples, hosted for free on GitHub Pages:
* [All taxa with GBIF occurrence records from Guam](https://aubreymoore.github.io/OccuTree/gbif-occurrences-Guam.html)
* [Insects with GBIF occurrence records from Guam](https://aubreymoore.github.io/OccuTree/gbif-occurrences-Guam-Insecta.html)

Source code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook (Python) which can be run for free on Google Colab (see [tutorial](tutorial.md)).

## ToDo
